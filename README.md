a website that was supposed to be a candidate for my highschool's web design tournament <br>
however we did not know that the theme was a website for our school and not anything until 2 days before the deadline, rendering this website useless.<br>
The translation doesnt work on github pages but works on live server (in VSCode), most things are NOT responsive as i stopped making the site as soon as the news broke out.<br>
You can copy the code, take parts, do whatever you want with this repository, you dont need to credit at all.<br>
